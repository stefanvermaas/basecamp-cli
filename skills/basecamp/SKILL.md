# Basecamp CLI

Interact with Basecamp projects and card tables using the `basecamp` command. All output is JSON for easy parsing with `jq`.

## Prerequisites

The CLI must be installed and authenticated:

```bash
basecamp version  # Verify installation
basecamp projects  # Verify authentication
```

If not authenticated, the user needs to run `basecamp auth`.

## Commands

### List projects

```bash
basecamp projects
```

Output:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 12345678,
    "name": "Website Redesign",

    "status": "active"
  },
  {
    "id": 23456789,
    "name": "Mobile App",
    "status": "active"
  }
]
```

### List boards in a project

```bash
basecamp boards <project_id>
```

```bash
basecamp cards <project_id> <board_id>
basecamp cards <project_id> <board_id> --column "In Progress"
```

Output:

    }
  ]
}
```

### View card details

### Move a card

```bash
basecamp move <project_id> <board_id> <card_id> --to "Done"
```

  "status": "ok",
  "card_id": "44444444",
  "column": "Done",
  "message": "Card 44444444 moved to 'Done'"
}
```

## Workflow example

To check what's being worked on and move a completed card:

```bash
# Find the project
basecamp projects | jq '.[] | select(.status == "active")'

# Find the board
basecamp boards 12345678

# See cards in progress
basecamp cards 12345678 87654321 --column "Progress"

# View details of a specific card
basecamp card 12345678 44444444 --comments

# Move it to Done
basecamp move 12345678 87654321 44444444 --to "Done"
```

## Configuration

Config files follow XDG Base Directory spec:

| File | Path |
|------|------|
| Config | `~/.config/basecamp/config.json` |
| Token | `~/.local/share/basecamp/token.json` |

To set up from scratch:
```bash
basecamp init   # Configure client_id, client_secret, account_id
basecamp auth   # Authenticate via OAuth
```

## Error handling

Errors are returned as JSON on stderr:
```json
{"error": "not authenticated, run 'basecamp auth' first"}
```

If you see "not authenticated" or "token expired", the user needs to run:
```bash
basecamp auth
```
